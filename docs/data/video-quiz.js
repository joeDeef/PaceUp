      "[00:00] Today we're making one of my favorite 10-minute weeknight meals. It's a one pan recipe, it's easy, quick, and most importantly it's delicious.",
      "[00:04] It's creamy, comforting, and this will quickly become a family favorite.",
      "[00:06] You'll only need three ingredients. You've heard me, believe it or not, the authentic Italian Alfredo is in fact only three main ingredients.",
      "[00:10] And while this recipe is the authentic version, I'm going to show you my method to making this creamy pasta because this recipe has no cream whatsoever.",
      "[00:13] We're really relying on the starchy water to make a creamy sauce.",
      "[00:15] Now I know lots of people like to cook the pasta separately and add some ladles of water into the sauce at the end.",
      "[00:17] Often though, this results in adding very small amounts of starch because the starch is so diluted by the large volume of pasta water.",
      "[00:20] Cooking everything in one pan means keeping all the starch from the pasta water.",
      "[00:23] In a large pan, add the fettucine.",
      "[00:26] Now, here in Italy, we only have one type of fettuccine, and that's egg pasta. I think in America you can also get this kind right here.",
      "[00:30] Do not use this pasta. You want to use egg fettuccine for this recipe, which can be found in any supermarket by the way.",
      "[00:34] You do want to use a large enough pan because the pasta, as it cooks, will expand.",
      "[00:36] Add the water and add the salt. Do not eyeball the salt. The full ingredient amounts will be in the description box below.",
      "[00:40] You want to cover your pasta, turn on your flame to medium, and let this come to a gentle boil.",
      "[00:42] Once it comes to a boil, gently loosen those noodles and give your pasta a gentle stir and cover again.",
      "[00:46] You don’t want to walk away because you will have to stir the pasta from time to time.",
      "[00:49] It's a small price to pay. It's a quick meal but it does require your full attention.",
      "[00:51] You want to cook the pasta according to the timing that you can find on your packaging.",
      "[00:53] Usually egg pastas take anywhere between 6 to 8 minutes. Mine took 7 minutes, so for 7 minutes I'm going to babysit this.",
      "[00:57] We don’t want the water to boil over and stirring it occasionally helps with even cooking.",
      "[01:00] Once the minutes are up, meaning that you’ve cooked the pasta according to the time on your packaging, you’re going to put the flame on high.",
      "[01:04] Get rid of that lid, and if you have any leftover water like I do, just let this go on a rolling boil for a minute and most of it will evaporate.",
      "[01:07] We don’t want the water to evaporate completely though, because we do need it to make this sauce.",
      "[01:10] So once you have about an inch left of water, you're going to turn your flame to low and add your butter and your grated parmesan.",
      "[01:14] If you're new to my channel, by the way, hello, hello there, welcome. Make sure to subscribe and click that bell. I post new videos every week.",
      "[01:17] You want to mix everything well and this is ready to be served.",
      "[01:20] Depending on how loose or thick you like your sauce, you can leave it on the stove a bit less or a bit longer.",
      "[01:23] Just keep in mind, as this sits, it will continue to thicken.",
      "[01:26] Okay, I’m going to turn off my stove. You can add some black pepper, some parsley. All of this is optional.",
      "[01:30] Because as I said, the original recipe is in fact just three ingredients, and I know this is such a simple recipe.",
      "[01:34] But this is pure comfort food for Italians. It's buttery and creamy. If you come home late one night, make this. It’s delicious."

      "[00:03] About three years ago this run and gun action game was announced and since then I’ve been closely following it.",
      "[00:07] After some delays in production it finally touched down a week ago.",
      "[00:12] It’s most striking feature is that it’s almost completely hand-drawn on animation paper and then digitized to achieve an old-timey feel.",
      "[00:17] And its music and sound effects also reflect this strive for authenticity.",
      "[00:19] However, the fantastic animations and sounds would be nothing without the very inventive level design.",
      "[00:23] All bosses have multiple stages, that while frustrating to fight, are original and interesting.",
      "[00:28] The same goes for the run and gun levels which incorporate different mechanics and foes.",
      "[00:34] And also because the controls are responsive and the enemies have good hitboxes, the player always feels in control.",
      "[00:39] There are also different types of weapons and upgrades, that are unlocked either through specific in-game levels or bought with in-game currency.",
      "[00:45] And also, there is two-player local co-op which is great fun.",
      "[00:52] After beating the final boss a new game-mode is unlocked that doesn’t introduce new mechanics, but only speeds up the existing levels, which provides a bit of replayability.",
      "[01:03] However, the game is tough even without it, so people who wanted something more forgiving aren’t going to find it here.",
      "[01:07] And while I don’t have a problem with hard games in general, I believe that it negatively impacts Cuphead, as it has a lot of unique aspects not related to difficulty.",
      "[01:13] And if the game had an easier setting, that could have opened it up to more people.",
      "[01:17] Overall I think Cuphead is a rare experience, that is sometimes overshadowed by its own difficulty."
